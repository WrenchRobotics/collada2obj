# Convert Base to an `.obj` file when collada file contains polylist

This example attempts to convert a collada file to an `.obj` file using the `collada2obj` library. The collada file contains a polylist, which is a more complex geometry type than a simple triangle list. This example is used to test the `collada2obj` library's ability to handle more complex geometry types.
